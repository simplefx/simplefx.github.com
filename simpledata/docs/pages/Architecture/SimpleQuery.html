	<h2>The SimpleQuery Object</h2>
<p>SimpleQuery is a dynamic type which allows queries to be constructed in a fluent style that resembles the dotted notation form of LINQ. The query executes when it is enumerated in any way, so all this should be transparent to you, and backwards-compatible with any existing code.</p>
<p>You can iterate through a SimpleQuery object to find SimpleRecord objects corresponding to each row of data returned from your data source.</p>
