<h2>Notes on the Documentation for Simple.Data</h2>
<p>Simple.Data offers you the opportunity to code against many databases in more IDEs, so for the purposes of this documentation the following choices have been made</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>IDE</em> : Visual Studio 2010</li>
	<li><em>Server</em> : SQL Server 2008</li>
	<li><em>Database</em> : MVCMusicStore</li>
	<li><em>Language</em> : C#</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sample Code</h3>
<p>All samples in this documentation are part of the Simple.Data.Sample package which you can download as a NuGet package or from github at <a href="https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data.Sample">https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data.Sample</a></p>
<ul>
	<li>All code snippets in the documentation assume that there is a variable db which was returned from one of the Simple.Data Database.Open...(...) methods.</li>
	<li>Unless explicitly mentioned, all code snippets which run an operation against the database will also show the SQL generated by that code using the ADO adapter and the SqlServer provider. Obviously Simple.Data is not just a SQL wrapper, but this convention should be most easily understood by the widest audience.</li>
	<li>In the &#8216;Generated SQL&#8217; code, parameters will be shown as simple assignments before the SQL in which they are used. This is just a convenient shorthand notation and not valid SQL. At runtime in the ADO adapter, parameters are handled through the IDbCommand.Parameters collection.</li>
</ul>
