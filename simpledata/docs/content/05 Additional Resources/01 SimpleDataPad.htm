<p>Simple.Data.Pad (<a href="https://github.com/downloads/markrendle/Simple.Data/Simple.Data.Pad-1.0.zip">download here</a>) is a GUI tool a bit like LINQPad, except it only works with Simple.Data. To use it, extract it from its zip archive onto a local disk, and run Simple.Data.Pad.exe.</p>
<p>The drop-down at the top left lets you choose an Open... method, and you can enter the parameters in the text boxes that appear when you've chosen one. Simple.Data.Pad comes with the SqlServer assembly, but you can drop any of the other adapter or provider assemblies in the app folder and it should pick them up.</p>
<p>To run a query, type it into the big text box. As you type, you should get an autocomplete box showing you available methods and properties, generated from the schema of the database you&#8217;re connected to.</p>
<p>Press F5 to run queries.</p>
<p>The Trace tab should show the SQL that was run against the database for the most recent query.</p>
<p>v1.0.0.0 is in no way anywhere near production quality. In particular, it doesn&#8217;t handle exceptions yet. It won&#8217;t kill you, though, or do bad things to your database, although stick to Find and Query operations for the time being.</p>
