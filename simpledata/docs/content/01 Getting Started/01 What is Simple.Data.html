<h2>What is Simple.Data?</h2>
<p>Simple.Data is a lightweight framework that uses the dynamic features of .NET 4 to provide an expressive, ORM-ish way of accessing and manipulating data without any of the  code pre-generation and boilerplate required by other frameworks. Instead, it interprets method and property names at runtime and maps them to your underlying data-store using a convention-based approach. It does not permit SQL Injection. It was built by Mark Rendle <a href="http://blog.markrendle.net/2010/08/05/introducing-simple-data/">in reaction to Microsoft&#8217;s release of Microsoft.Data.dll</a>, taking Ruby&#8217;s <a href="http://ar.rubyonrails.org/">ActiveRecord</a> and <a href="http://datamapper.org/">DataMapper</a> gems as its inspiration.</p>
<blockquote>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an O/RM. It looks a bit like one, but it doesn&#8217;t need objects, it doesn&#8217;t need a relational database, and it doesn&#8217;t need any mapping configuration. So it&#8217;s an O/RM without the O or the R or the M. So it&#8217;s just a /.&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s take an example</p>
<pre class="brush:csharp">public Album FindAlbumsByTitle(string title)
{
	 return Database.Open().Albums.FindAllByTitle(title);
}</pre>
<p>In this example,</p>
<ul>
	<li><code class="method">Database.Open()</code> is dynamic and has no pre-defined <code class="property">Albums</code> property.</li>
	<li><code class="property">Albums</code> is returned as a <code class="type">DynamicTable</code>, which is also dynamic. It has no pre-defined <code class="method">FindAllByTitle()</code> method.</li>
	<li>When Simple.Data sees a call to a <code class="method">FindAllBy*()</code> method, it pulls apart the rest of the method name, combines it with the arguments and builds an ADO.NET command which safely encapsulates the name and password values inside parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming you&#8217;re using Simple.Data to access a SQL-based database, the following SQL (or similar depending on your database) is generated along with the requisite boilerplate code to send it to the database and retrieve the resulting data.</p>
<pre class="brush:sql">SELECT * FROM Albums WHERE Title = @p1</pre>
<p>Simple.Data is not limited to SQL databases. The developer community has also built providers to run Simple.Data against several noSQL data stores.</p>
<p>Simple.Data runs on the .NET Framework and Mono.</p>
