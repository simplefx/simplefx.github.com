<h2>Where to get Simple.Data</h2>
<h3>Via nuGet</h3>
<p>Currently, the best way to get Simple.Data into your project is using the nuGet package manager. Install the package for the specific adapter or provider you want to use, and NuGet will install <a href="03 Requirements and Dependencies.html">the necessary dependencies</a> automatically. For example, if you are using SQL Server in your project, just go to the Package Manager Console and run:</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../images/nuGetInstallCommand.png" /></p>
<p>This will install the Core package, the Ado adaptor package, and the Provider for SQL Server.</p>
<h3>Via gitHub</h3>
<p>If you do not have access to nuGet, Simple.Data.Core and all its adaptors and providers are hosted on <a href="http://github.com/markrendle">github.com</a>, where you can either</p> 
<ul>
	<li>fork and clone the projects to build them yourself</li>
	<li>download the binaries as zip or tgz files.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Via OpenWrap</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.openwrap.org/">OpenWrap</a> support for SImple.Data is planned, but not yet implemented.</p>
